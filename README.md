# Text to MBTI (Zero Shot - model)
ðŸ˜„ For fun: MBTI Translator - Infer probable MBTI from your sentence, using zero-shot NLI model. 

## About the project & Examples
* Please give a sentence as a input
* If possible, give a sentence which could imply your 'type' indicator

## Example of input & output:
```
Input: "I stayed home all day"

===

Output:

## Model and requirements
* Model: https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli
* Using Zero-shot text classification model
* required to setup torch & transformer library. Pleaase setup virtual environment
* >> 02.20 update: Highly recommend using requirement.txt to enable frontend UI using streamlit

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*  For torch & transformer evironment setting, please refer to: https://pytorch.org
```
pip install transformers
```
